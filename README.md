# Quota Float

Lightweight floating desktop widget for checking Codex quota from the local Codex Desktop login state.

![Quota Float quota states](docs/images/quota-states.png)

## Highlights

- Shows your Codex plan, 5-hour quota, weekly quota, and next reset time in a compact always-on-top widget.
- Uses clear quota states for healthy, caution, and critical remaining usage.
- Switches between the full panel and a small floating orb from the top-left control.
- Indicates whether quota is currently being consumed.
- Includes quick controls for language switching and always-on-top behavior.
- Lets you hide the quota panel when it overlaps the Codex interface and restore it from the system tray; the choice persists across restarts.
- Switches directly between the full 320 × 320 panel and the original compact 100 × 100 quota orb from an in-panel control. On Windows, size and bottom-right position are committed together, and the chosen mode persists across restarts.
- Keeps the panel fixed instead of advertising or starting manual window dragging; Windows placement continues to follow the ChatGPT host window.
- Shows reset credit count and available reset-credit expiration times when the quota service provides them.
- Handles stale data, signed-out sessions, unavailable quota responses, and loading states without fabricating values.

## How It Works

Quota Float reads the existing Codex Desktop login state on your machine and queries Codex/ChatGPT quota endpoints with that session. It does not estimate usage from local token counts and does not redeem reset credits or modify account settings.

Browser preview uses mock data. Real quota reading requires the Tauri desktop app and an existing Codex Desktop login on the same machine.

## Download

For normal users, download the latest unsigned build from GitHub Releases:

- Latest release: https://github.com/change-42-yhmm/quota-float/releases/latest
- Windows: `quota-float-windows-unsigned.zip`
- macOS Universal: `quota-float-macos-universal-unsigned.zip`

Unzip it and run the app. Unsigned builds may trigger Windows SmartScreen or macOS Gatekeeper warnings. Public distribution to non-technical users should use signed Windows builds and notarized macOS builds.

## Feedback

## Privacy Boundary

Quota Float is local-first and intentionally narrow:

- Reads the local Codex Desktop login state only to query Codex quota.
- Sends the existing Codex access token only to ChatGPT quota endpoints.
- Stores only widget preferences in its own app config directory.
- Does not store Codex tokens, account IDs, prompts, chat history, raw quota responses, or local auth paths.
- Does not include telemetry, analytics, crash reporting, or third-party tracking.
- Does not redeem reset credits or modify account settings.

See [PRIVACY.md](PRIVACY.md) and [SECURITY.md](SECURITY.md) for the full boundary.

## Accuracy Boundary

Codex quota is read from Codex/ChatGPT quota service responses. If the response format changes, the app shows an unavailable or stale state instead of inventing quota values.

## Development

Requirements:

- Node.js 20+
- Rust stable
- Tauri 2 system dependencies for your platform

```bash
npm install
npm run dev
npm run test
npm run build
npm run tauri dev
```

## Build

```bash
npm run tauri build
```

On Windows, Tauri may download WiX to create an MSI installer. If WiX download fails, the release executable may still be produced at:

```text
src-tauri/target/release/quota-float.exe
```

## Release

GitHub Actions are configured for:

- CI on push/PR: frontend tests, Rust tests, web build, Tauri build.
- `v*` tags: verified unsigned Windows and macOS Universal bundle artifacts, SHA-256 checksums, and a draft GitHub Release for manual review.

See [docs/GITHUB-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md](docs/GITHUB-RELEASE-CHECKLIST.md) before publishing a version for others.

Do not upload local credentials, `.codex`, `.env*`, screenshots with personal data, `node_modules`, `dist`, `src-tauri/target`, or local installers to source control.
