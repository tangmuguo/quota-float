## Downloads

- Windows unsigned: `quota-float-windows-unsigned.zip`
- macOS Universal unsigned: `quota-float-macos-universal-unsigned.zip`
- SHA-256 checksums: `SHA256SUMS.txt`

## What's new

- Localizes runtime error notices in Chinese and English, including live language changes while an error is visible.
- Updates every tray menu label immediately when the language changes without resetting checked states.
- Adds a top-left compact button that switches directly between the 320x320 expanded panel and the 100x100 compact panel.
- Keeps both visual states ready so the native window and interface change together without a visible resize-then-move sequence.
- Persists the selected panel mode and keeps rapid toggles serialized.
- Improves host-following window placement and compact-state error feedback.
- Removes the misleading draggable cursor and manual drag capability so the panel stays fixed.

## Install

2. Download the package for your platform.

## Privacy

## Notes

- This release is unsigned. Windows may show an unknown publisher warning; macOS may show a Gatekeeper warning.
- Codex quota is read from non-public quota service responses and may stop working if the response shape changes.
- The app shows stale/unavailable states instead of estimating quota.
- Windows and macOS builds share the same React/CSS UI and behavior layer.
